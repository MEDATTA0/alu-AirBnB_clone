This is a command line interpreter (CLI) for a simple object oriented storage system through the terminal. The system supports the CRUD operations done in-memory.

This interpreter is made using Python's cmd module and interacts with the storage module which manages the objects. The HBNBCommand class provides the necessary command to handle operations.
